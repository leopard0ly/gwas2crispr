Title: GWAS-to-CRISPR Data Pipeline for High-Throughput SNP Target Extraction
Version: 0.1.0

Description: Provides a reproducible and automated pipeline to extract, process,
    and export significant GWAS single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for any
    human trait or disease (identified by its EFO identifier). Given a trait
    and a p-value threshold, the package retrieves significant SNPs, annotates
    their gene context, and outputs comprehensive metadata tables (CSV), BED
    intervals for genomic intersection, and FASTA sequences with user-defined
    flanking regions. Outputs integrate with downstream functional genomics
    tools and CRISPR guide design software.
